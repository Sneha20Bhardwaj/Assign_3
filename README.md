This repository contains the two task of Assignment 3 of Python Course.

Task 1 is to calculate the factorial of a number using loop or recursion
The code file for task 1 is CQ1.The program calculates the factorial of a integer taken as input from user. The 'recursion1() function calculates the factorial of input number using loop mechanism and the recursion2() function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion mechanism.

Task 2 is to do some calulation using math module
The code file for task 2 is CQ2. The program imports the built-in Math Module and uses some of its functions like sqrt (to calculate square root), sin (to calculate sine ) and log(to calculate natural logarithm of the number). The number on which calculation is taken from the user.
